## TASK 6.2

1. Use already created internal-network for three VMs (VM1-VM3). VM1 has NAT and internal,
VM2, VM3 â€“ internal only interfaces.

I created firs virtual machine (VM1) that has 2 interfaces (NAT and internal), network config file of machine - [image1](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/vmmainconf.png)

The second virtual machine (VM2) that has one interface (internal), network config file of machine - [image2](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/vm2conf.png)

The third virtual machine (VM3) that has one interface (internal), network config file of machine - [image3](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/vm3conf.png)

2. Install and configure DHCP server on VM1.

I installed adn configures DHCP server dnsmasq. 

My /etc/dnsmasq.conf - [image4](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/dnsmasqconf1.png),[image5](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/dnsmasqconf2.png)

My /etc/resolv.conf - [image6](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/resolvmain.png)

My /etc/dhcp/dhcpclient.conf - [image7](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/dhcp_clientconf.png)

3. Check VM2 and VM3 for obtaining network addresses from DHCP server.

4. Using existed network for three VMs (from p.1) install and configure DNS server on VM1. (You can
use DNSMASQ, BIND9 or something else).

I configured DNS server on VM1 and my machines have the internet access - [image9](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/dhcalldig.png)

Also I configured DHCP by virtualbox [image10](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/vboxdhcp1.png), [image11](https://github.com/rostislavkozlov07/DevOps_online_Vinnytsia_2021Q2/blob/main/m6/task6.2/image/vboxdhcp2.png)
